"PGP (“pretty good privacy”) ([on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy)) is a standard for encrypting and signing messages. Every person using PGP posesses a pair of a private and a public key. The public key you can send to everyone you want to exchange messages with, the private key, which is encrypted with a password, you keep safe. When you send a message to someone else, you can encrypt it using their public key, but it can only be decrypted by the person who posesses the private key belonging to that public key. This way, everyone can encrypt messages addressed to a specific person, but only the person themselves can decrypt it.\n"
"\n"
"You can also sign a message with your private key, and everyone can verify with your public key that the message has been signed by you. This way, it can be verified that the author of a message is the actual person they claim to be, as only they who posess the private key can make a signature with it.\n"
"\n"
"As everyone can create PGP keys with any name and e-mail address they like, PGP uses the so-called “Web of Trust” to verify that a key actually belongs to the person you want to communicate with. Everyone can sign someone elses key when they are sure (by meeting them in person and possibly checking their government-issued ID card) that the name and e-mail address set in the key are correct. This way, a “chain of trust” can be built: When you have signed a friend’s key and this friend has signed another person’s key, you can be pretty sure that that other person’s key can be trusted.\n"
"\n"
"A PGP key server is a website where people can upload their public keys. This makes it easy for people to encrypt messages they send to them, as they can search the key online, and it is not necessary for the recipient to manually send their public key to everyone they want to receive messages from. Also, a key server aggregates key signatures that people upload, which can increase the trustworthiness of keys, as a key is more trustworthy the more keys have signed it that you trust. Without a key server, this amount of trust could only be achieved by re-sending your key to everyone you have given it to every time someone new signs it. This is particularly important for so-called “revocation signatures”. When for example your laptop is stolen, there is a probability that someone has access to your private key, so it is not safe to use it anymore. When you revoke the key and upload the revocation signature to a key server, everyone who wants to send a message to you will see that it is not safe to encrypt it with that key."

See [CAcert’s manual](http://wiki.cacert.org/FAQ/ImportRootCert) on how to do this. Alternatively, you might disable encryption by replacing `hkps://` with `hkp://` in the keyserver URL. Note that this is **insecure**, as other people might spoof your keyring, especially if you are on a wireless connection."

"#### Key privacy settings ####\n"
"\n"
"On a traditional key server, everyone can upload any key they like, including all signatures on that key. Some people don’t like it when everyone can see who has signed their key, as this might reveal sensitive information about social connections. This has the effect that among people where privacy is important, key servers are often not used, which decreases security as it gets more difficult to spread new signatures, which is particularly important for revocation signatures. On gnewpg, newly uploaded keys are automatically marked as private, which means that only people who already posess the key will be able to receive new signatures for it. People can prove that they posess a key by uploading it. The privacy settings of a key can be changed by its verified owner.\n"
"\n"
"When a registered user uploads a key, the key will be added to the keyring of their user account. This enables them to receive updates for the key without having to upload it every time. Also, each user gets a personal keyserver URL, which they can use in their local PGP application to access not only keys that are public, but also non-public keys in the keyring of their user-account.\n"
"\n"
"#### Security information about keys ####\n"
"\n"
"Traditional key servers only list keys, but they do not show any information about their trustworthiness. Only after downloading a key from a key server you can see in your local PGP application whether the key can be trusted. gnewpg tries to give as detailed information as possible about whether a key can be trusted, by analysing the security of the algorithms used and by verifying the names and e-mail addresses used in keys.\n"
"\n"
"#### Groups ####\n"
"\n"
"You can create groups of keys on gnewpg. Each group is accessed by a specific URL, and everyone who posesses this URL can access the group. Depending on what settings the creator of the group makes, either everyone or only specific people can add keys to the group. You can for example create a group for your organisation and give its URL to all members. This way, all members of your organisation can see the keys of all other members, without those keys having to be visible to the whole world."

"The keyring is your personal collection of public keys.
